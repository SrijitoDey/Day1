1.What is validations in client side programming?
2.Why do we perform validations?

1-Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.
2-Validating the accuracy, clarity, and details of data is necessary to mitigate any project defects. Without validating data, you run the risk of basing decisions on data with imperfections that are not accurately representative of the situation at hand.
